  title: Deploying an App Engine App
  language: app-engine
---

We are going to deploy our App Engine app to the Internet! You can `git clone` this repo to get an example app called `my-app` to deploy.

# Instructions

1. Visit the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/project) and click "Create Project". You can also access this by clicking the Dashboard button on GoogleAppEngineLauncher
2. You should see a dialog like this:

  ![Create screen 1](http://i.imgur.com/SME2wp7m.png)
3. Fill in "Project name" with a name -- it could be any name (does not have to match your project folder).

  As you are filling in the project name, there should be small text under the text box that tells you your project id. In this example, our project id is "magnetic-set-102113". You will have a different project id.

  **Copy your project id** since we'll need it in a few steps!

4. Click "Create"

# Command Line
5. Now go to Terminal, and `cd` into the directory of your App Engine project.
  * If you `git clone` this repository, this means you should `cd cssi-7-deploy-app-engine/my-app`
6. Run this command **using your own project id**

  `appcfg.py --oauth2 -A magnetic-set-102113 update .`


  Note: **do not use "magnetic-set-102113"** -- you need to use the project id from step 3!

 This may open up a screen like this in Chrome:

 ![Accept auth](http://i.imgur.com/7jYywmRm.png)

 If you see this, click "Accept"

 The terminal should show something like the following:

 ```
Authentication successful.

10:13 AM Cloning 3 application files.

```

# AppEngine GUI
If you're more comfortable with the GUI, you simply need to open the .yaml file for your application. Change the application value to the exact project id from the developer's console. Then you can click Deploy on the GUI.

```
application: **magnetic-set-102113**
version: 1
runtime: python27
api_version: 1
threadsafe: yes
```
